# Changelog

## 2.2.1

* Potential fix of [#65](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/krontab/issues/65)
* Versions
  * `Kotlin`: `1.9.20-Beta`
  * `Klock`: `4.0.10`
  * `Serialization`: `1.6.0`

## 2.2.0

* Versions
  * `Kotlin`: `1.9.0`
  * `Coroutines`: `1.7.3`
  * `Klock`: `4.0.9`

## 2.1.2

* Versions
  * `Coroutines`: `1.7.2`
* All callbacks for standard extensions like `doInfinity` now fully inline

## 2.1.1

* `asFlowWithoutDelays` and `asTzFlowWithoutDelays` will have nullable `since` parameters with default to `null`
  to avoid any inconsistency of `Flow` idiom.
  <details>
    <summary>About the reason of changes</summary>
    Cold flows should not contain some state by default. So, it was not right to save some `DateTime`/`DateTimeTz`
    by default. Now it will not use some external state unless developers will set it manually
  </details>

## 2.1.0

* Versions
  * `Kotlin`: `1.8.22`
  * `Klock`: `4.0.3`
* New value class `KrontabConfig`. It is preferable way to create `KronScheduler` instead of
  `KrontabTemplate` since this update
* You may configure krontab with builders using simple `KronScheduler` invoke extension
* New useful extensions like `KronScheduler.daily`
* `KrontabTemplateWrapper` is obsolete in favor to `KrontabConfig`

## 2.0.0

* Versions
  * `Kotlin`: `1.8.21`
  * `Klock`: `4.0.1`
* Support of `mingwx64` platform

## 1.0.0

* Versions
  * `Kotlin`: `1.8.20`
  * `AndroidXWork`: `2.8.1`

## 0.10.0

* New extensions for `KronScheduler`:
  * `asTzFlowWithoutDelays`/`asFlowWithoutDelays`
  * `asTzFlowWithDelays`/`asFlowWithDelays`
* Old `KronScheduler.asFlow` and `KronScheduler.asTzFlow` temporarily marked as deprecated: after several versions their
behaviour will be changed to undelayed one
* All the flow extensions now use `cold` non-channel flows. Potentially it should increase performance and decrease memory usage
